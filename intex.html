            Mount Fuji, highest mountain in Japan. It rises to 12,388 feet (3,776 metres) near the Pacific Ocean coast in Yamanashi
            and Shizuoka ken (prefectures) of central Honshu, about 60 miles (100 km) west of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area.
            It is a volcano that has been dormant since its last eruption, in 1707, but is still generally classified as active by
            geologists. The mountain is the major feature of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park (1936), and it is at the centre of a
            UNESCO World Heritage site designated in 2013.
